asterisk-externhost
===================

Bash script to replace externhost functionality.

Why:

- There's no externhost equivalent for the pjsip resource in Asterisk 12 which makes it impossible to use behind a dynamic IP

How to use:

- make sure the ipupdate.sh file has execute permissions for root
- there are two possible arguments:
  1) a hostname. This is required to do the DNS lookup
  2) "silent".  If not present then the output is echoed to stdout. If it is there the script is silent (for cron jobs)
- add something similar to this to root's crontab:

* * * * * /path/to/script/ipupdate.sh extern.hayesey.co.uk silent

with your own path and your own hostname.  That will run once a minute.

It will work for both sip.conf & pjsip.conf.

Have fun.
